UK Train Rides: Performance & Punctuality Analysis

📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes UK train operating data to identify performance trends, root causes of delays, and passenger journey impacts. Using Power BI for data integration, analysis, and visualization, we deliver actionable insights to help travelers make informed decisions and provide stakeholders with a clear view of network performance.

🎯 Business Objectives

Improve Travel Planning: Identify the most reliable train operators, routes, and times for travel.

Understand Delay Causes: Analyze root causes and patterns of delays and cancellations across the network.

Performance Benchmarking: Compare the performance of different Train Operating Companies (TOCs) against each other and national standards.

Data-Driven Decisions: Provide commuters, leisure travelers, and transport analysts with comprehensive, interactive dashboards.

🔧 Tools & Technologies

Power BI: Data integration, transformation, analysis, and interactive dashboard creation.

CSV/JSON: Primary data formats sourced from public APIs and repositories.

Python (Optional): For advanced data scraping and preprocessing (if API data is complex).

GitHub: Version control, project management, and public sharing of methodology and visualizations.

🚀 Project Phases

Phase 1: Data Acquisition & Preprocessing

Duration: Week 1-2

Objective: Source, clean, and model UK rail performance data (e.g., from Office of Rail and Road (ORR) or Network Rail data feeds).

Tools: Power BI, Python (optional for API handling)

Deliverables:

Cleaned, merged dataset ready for analysis (/data/processed/).

Data dictionary and preprocessing documentation (/analysis/preprocessing/).

Data quality assessment report.

Phase 2: Analysis & Question Definition

Duration: Week 2-3

Objective: Define key performance questions for travelers and analysts (e.g., "Which London-to-Edinburgh service has the best punctuality record?", "What is the primary cause of delays on the West Coast Mainline?").

Tools: Power BI

Deliverables:

A complete set of analysis questions and KPIs (/analysis/findings/).

Defined metrics (Punctuality %, Cancellation %, Average Delay Minutes).

Initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) visuals.

Phase 3: Dashboard Development

Duration: Week 3-4

Objective: Build an interactive, user-friendly Power BI dashboard for exploring UK train performance.

Tools: Power BI

Deliverables:

Interactive Power BI dashboard (/powerbi/reports/).

Key visuals: Performance by TOC, route reliability heatmaps, time-series trends of delays, root cause analysis charts.

Dashboard user guide (/documentation/).

Phase 4: Insight Reporting & Presentation

Duration: Week 4

Objective: Compile findings into a summary report and presentation for stakeholders and the public.

Deliverables:

Final insight report with key takeaways and recommendations (/reports/final_report.pdf).

Executive presentation deck summarizing the project (/presentations/).

Public blog post or summary of findings.
